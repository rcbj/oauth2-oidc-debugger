// File: url_safety.js
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One check, applied wherever this app navigates the browser to a URL it did
// not write itself: **the scheme must be http or https**.
//
// Every such URL here is user-supplied in the ordinary course of using a
// debugger — you type an IdP's sign-in endpoint, or a signed redirect is built
// from it, and the page then does `window.location.assign(...)` or submits a
// form to it. `javascript:` is a URL scheme, so a value that reaches one of
// those sinks unchecked is script execution, and `data:`/`blob:` are
// same-page-origin document loads. A scheme allowlist is what closes that, and
// it is the whole of what these sinks need.
//
// **This is deliberately not DOMPurify.** That is an HTML sanitizer: given a
// URL it parses it as an HTML fragment and hands most of it back. Measured
// against dompurify 3.x, `DOMPurify.sanitize('javascript:alert(1)')` returns
// the string **unchanged**, as does the `java\tscript:` form — so at a
// navigation sink it looks like a control and is not one, which is the whole
// point. (`data:text/html,<script>…</script>` it truncates to
// `data:text/html,`, mangled but still a `data:` URL.) Sanitizing is the wrong
// verb here in any case: a URL is not markup to be cleaned, it is a value to be
// accepted or refused.
//
// It is also lossy on the URLs that matter, though less often than one might
// assume: an ordinary `?a=1&b=2` survives it intact, but a URL containing `<`
// or `>` has that content **dropped** and its `&` escaped to `&amp;`. So it
// both fails to stop the attack and quietly corrupts a class of legitimate
// input. `tests/url_safety.js` pins both halves of that against the real
// package rather than leaving them as an assertion in a comment.
//
// The parsing is left to the WHATWG URL parser rather than a regular
// expression, because the interesting inputs are the ones that do not look
// like what they are: the parser strips tab and newline characters from inside
// a scheme and ignores leading C0 controls and spaces, so `java\tscript:` and
// `javascript:` both resolve to the `javascript:` protocol and are
// refused here, while a regex over the raw string sees neither.
// `tests/url_safety.js` holds that, case by case.
