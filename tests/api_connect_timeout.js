// File: api_connect_timeout.js
//
// The api's outbound LIMITS: api/connect_timeout.js, and the four settings in
// api/env/*.js that bound every axios call the service makes — callTimeout,
// connectionTimeout, maxContentLength and maxRedirects — plus the userAgent those
// calls identify themselves with, and the keepAlive that pools their connections.
// axios's own defaults are no timeout, no connect-phase timeout at all, an
// unlimited response size, 21 redirects and a User-Agent of "axios/x.y.z", so each
// has to be passed explicitly at every call site — which is the other half of what
// this checks, by reading server.js.
//
// No browser and no services: node only, so it never skips.
//
// The property under test is the one that makes connectionTimeout worth having as
// a setting separate from callTimeout, and it is easy to implement something that
// merely LOOKS like it:
//
//   * a stalled CONNECT must be given up on at connectionTimeout;
//   * a connection that succeeded must NOT be — the budget is spent, and from
//     there on only callTimeout applies.
//
// The second half is what an AbortSignal.timeout (the obvious way to do this in
// axios, and what this code did first) gets wrong: it starts counting when it is
// created, so it kills a perfectly healthy slow response as readily as a dead
// host, and whichever of the two settings was smaller became the only one that
// ever fired. Case 2 below fails against that implementation and passes against
// this one, which is the whole reason it exists.
//
// TLS is checked separately because the disarm event differs: a TLSSocket that has
// completed the TCP handshake and then stalls mid-negotiation has emitted
// 'connect' but not 'secureConnect', so disarming on the wrong one leaves the
// stall unbounded.
