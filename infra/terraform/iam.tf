#   - S3     : full read/write on the four site buckets (prod + test content/logs)
#   - Route53: manage records in the shared idptools.com hosted zone (covers
#              apex, www, and test.idptools.com) — for DNS + ACM DNS validation
#   - ACM    : request/describe/delete/renew certificates in us-east-1
#              (CloudFront certs) and us-west-2 (regional)
#   - CloudFront: read/write (a global service; its actions do not support
#                 resource-level ARNs, so it is action-scoped on "*")
